# qiot-image-build

This project provides the needed scripts and files for building the custom fedora-iot image used at the edge in Quarkus IoT Project.

The build provess is based on the Anaconda/Kickstart projects.

Please refer to the pofficial base kickstart from the fedora community [here](https://pagure.io/fedora-kickstarts/raw/f33/f/fedora-iot.ks).

The overall build process takes roughly 2 hours, so be patient ;-)
